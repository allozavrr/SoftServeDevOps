1) Analyze the structure of the /etc/passwd and /etc/group file, what fields are present in it, what users exist on the system? Specify several pseudo-users, how to define them?

The /etc/passwd file is a colon-separated file that contains the following information:
Username.
Encrypted password.
User ID number (UID)
User's group ID number (GID)
Full name of the user (GECOS)
User home directory.
Login shell.
